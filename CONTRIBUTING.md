# Contributing to blueprinted.io

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project is building a task-driven, governed learning content system where **proof of capability** matters more than completion.

## Who should contribute?

We need both technical and learning-domain contributors:

- Engineers: storage, UI, import/export, governance workflows
- SMEs: pressure-test tasks/workflows against reality
- Reviewers: poke holes, find edge cases, propose model fixes

## How to contribute

- Open issues for bugs, feature requests, or methodology debates.
- Submit PRs that are focused (one feature/fix per PR is ideal).
- For larger design discussions, open an issue and label it appropriately.

## What contributions matter?

- Code: FastAPI prototype improvements, ingestion, export formats
- Schema/model: task/workflow structure, governance rules
- Content: example corpuses, validation heuristics
- Docs: clarify what the system is and how to run it

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Disagree with reasons, not rage.

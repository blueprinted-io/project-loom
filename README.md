# blueprinted.io: Learning Content System

## Executive Summary

blueprinted.io is a **database-defined learning content system** for technical operations.

It defines work as structured, governed records (Tasks + Workflows) so content does not drift, contradict itself, or rot the moment reality changes.

---

> **Status: MVP complete — active development has moved on.**
>
> This repository is the working proof-of-concept that validated the model: governed Tasks, Workflows, and Primers with a review lifecycle, PDF ingestion, and export to multiple training formats. It runs on SQLite with a FastAPI backend and is fully functional.
>
> The production platform is a ground-up rebuild on proper foundations — PostgreSQL + pgvector, real OIDC authentication, an API-first architecture, a redesigned ingestion pipeline, and a companion frontend. The governance model and record types are unchanged; the rebuild is about foundations, not a redesign. That work is private and in active development.
>
> This repo remains the best way to run blueprinted.io locally and understand the core model.

## Why (LearningOps)

Learning is still built like waterfall software: big launches, slow review cycles, and content that’s obsolete before it’s finished.

**LearningOps** is the alternative: build learning like software.

- break work into atomic units
- compose them into real outcomes
- version + review changes
- ship updates continuously
- keep everything auditable

## Live Demo

[https://app.blueprinted.io
](https://app.blueprinted.io/login)

## Quickstart (Run Locally)

The runnable MVP lives in `lcs_mvp/`.

```bash
cd lcs_mvp
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Seed the Debian demo dataset

```bash
cd lcs_mvp
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 seed/seed_debian_corpus.py --reset-db
```

### Switch between demo and blank database (admin)

Switch your role to `admin` in the UI, then open:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/db

### Roles (prototype)

Cookie-based role switching (not real auth):

- `viewer` / `author` / `reviewer`: normal app roles (no audit log)
- `audit`: read-only access, includes audit log
- `admin`: can see everything; can force submit/confirm (recorded in audit)

# SCORM, xAPI, and cmi5: What They Actually Are and What You Actually Get

### Why Adoption of Modern Standards Is Stuck

One of the biggest blockers in moving beyond SCORM isn’t technology, it’s business incentives and culture.

LMS vendors *know* SCORM is limited, but it’s a sunk cost for many organizations. SCORM support is a checkbox on their sales deck. Saying “our LMS doesn’t support SCORM” is a death sentence. So they keep supporting it while adding “xAPI/CMI5 support” mostly as a buzzword and integrating little of the actual technological backend.

The hard truth is: educating customers that embracing xAPI or cmi5 means completely reimagining how learning is designed, built, and measured is *not* a great sales pitch. It’s complicated, costly, and threatens the status quo.

As a result, many vendors promote modern standards as features in principle, but don’t help customers actually adopt them. For business leaders, this creates a catch-22: the tech exists but nobody is integrating it well because in order to sell it, vendors would need to fundamentally change the mindset of their customers.

Ultimately, the real challenge isn’t the specs themselves, it’s shifting the culture and expectations around learning development and measurement. Without that, changing standards is just swapping one box-ticking exercise for another.

This is the challenge I see business leaders facing. Although we're talking standards and protocols, it's really in how people see learning development that's the issue.

## SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model)

### What It Is

A legacy standard from the late 1990s/early 2000s, SCORM is a packaging and tracking format that lets you launch eLearning content from an LMS and track basic completion data.

### What You Actually Get

- Content that can launch and run inside an LMS  
- Tracking for:  
  - Completion  
  - Pass/fail  
  - Score  
  - Time spent  
- Bookmarking (i.e., resume where you left off)  
- Widespread LMS support

### What You *Don’t* Get

- Any tracking outside the LMS/browser  
- Insight into what learners are actually doing beyond “completed” or “passed”  
- Compatibility with modern learning formats (apps, VR, offline use)  
- Custom tracking or extensibility  
- Analytics that are meaningful in modern L&D

SCORM is *stable and known*, but extremely limited. It assumes learning only happens in tidy packages behind login screens. That’s not how people learn.

## xAPI (Experience API, aka Tin Can API)

### What It Is

xAPI is a flexible data format (JSON) and communication standard for tracking *any* learning experience. It moves beyond the LMS and can capture informal, offline, and experiential learning.

### What You Actually Get

- Tracking of learning anywhere: mobile, VR, in-person, simulations, etc.  
- Storage of learning records in a Learning Record Store (LRS)  
- Custom action verbs like “watched”, “repaired”, “mentored”, etc.  
- Decoupling of content from the LMS  
- Extensibility for bespoke tracking needs

### What You *Don’t* Get

- A standardized way to launch or structure content  
- Completion/pass/fail logic (you have to define it yourself, manually)  
- Cohesion, without strict implementation and significant development, an xAPI defined environment becomes a wild west of inconsistent data  
- Simplicity, implementing xAPI well requires significant dev effort and requires a ground up reimagining of instructional design

xAPI is powerful, but it’s *a toolset, not a solution*. You get raw capability, not plug-and-play usefulness.

## cmi5 (Computer Managed Instruction, 5th attempt)

### What It Is

cmi5 is a specification built on top of xAPI (technically it's a _profile_ of xAPI) that **reintroduces structure and launchability**, effectively acting as a proper replacement for SCORM.

### What You Actually Get

- LMS-based launch and tracking of content, just like SCORM  
- Standardized tracking using xAPI statements (completion, score, pass/fail)  
- A defined course structure and start/stop rules  
- Cleaner data in the LRS  
- Compatibility with modern content while retaining LMS delivery  
- Reusable xAPI statements and verbs with expected structure

### What You *Don’t* Get

- SCORM backward compatibility (you’ll need new content)  
- A silver bullet. Your learning content still needs to be modular and well-structured, and the need to reimagine learning strategy around xAPI still remains.  
- Broad adoption. cmi5 is emerging, but not yet universal and is often implemented in name only.

cmi5 is the spec xAPI should’ve shipped with. It closes the gaps and gives you the structure needed for real-world implementation but requires a different approach to learning scoping, development, implementation, evaluation and understanding.

## These Standards Weren’t Built for Compliance

SCORM, xAPI, and cmi5 often get dismissed as legacy baggage or needlessly complex. But that’s not what they were built for and not where they came from.

**AICC** (Aviation Industry CBT Committee) was formed in 1988 by airlines trying to standardize computer-based training for technical roles, pilots, engineers, ground crews. The goal wasn’t completion rates or policy acknowledgment. It was **proving competence in life-critical systems**.

In the late 1990s, the US Department of Defense launched the **Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)** initiative. SCORM came out of that, an attempt to create interoperable, reusable training for military applications. Later, ADL commissioned **xAPI** to expand tracking beyond LMS boundaries. **cmi5** was introduced to give xAPI the structure it needed for real-world adoption. ADL is still the steward of both specs today.

> These protocols weren’t dreamed up by vendors chasing compliance contracts.  
> They were designed for domains where **proving skill is non-negotiable**.

And that’s what makes the current situation so frustrating.

As corporate learning pivoted toward **completion-based compliance**, the standards themselves weren’t re-evaluated, they were just repurposed. Over time, the depth, intent, and precision of AICC’s origins got flattened into generic "eLearning packages" that track whether you clicked "Next."

**The real crime isn’t that SCORM or xAPI are outdated.**  
It’s that the industry dulled their edges to fit into LMS checklists and forgot what they were actually meant to do.

## The Hidden Cost of Flexibility

One of the biggest selling points of xAPI is its ability to track learning outside the LMS across apps, devices, classrooms, even real-world tasks.

This sounds great in a slide deck. But in practice?

**It means you now have to define, capture, store, and manage all that data yourself.**

Want to track on-the-job performance?  
You’ll need to decide:
- What actions you’re tracking  
- What verbs make sense  
- Who’s generating the statements  
- How you're validating that the data actually means something  

And then you’ll need to build the systems to collect and interpret that data.  
Or worse, outsource it and lose visibility anyway.

> xAPI gives you infinite flexibility, but **zero opinion** on how to use it.  
> That’s not a flaw, but it does make you responsible for everything.

This is where a lot of teams burn out.  
They want meaningful data but underestimate the *operational and administrative overhead* of getting it.

**xAPI is only powerful if you have the internal capability to wield it.**  
Otherwise, you just traded SCORM’s limits for a bottomless to-do list.

## The Real Issue: It’s Not Technical, It’s Cultural

The problem isn’t just SCORM vs xAPI vs cmi5. The real problem is that **modern learning standards only shine when paired with modern learning practices**.

These standards were designed to support:

- Modular, reusable content  
- Microlearning and just-in-time delivery  
- Data-driven L&D decision making  
- Blended, multi-platform learning experiences

**But none of that works if you’re still churning out 45-minute courses packed into a single file.**

### Bottom line:

> **SCORM is dying, xAPI is misunderstood, and cmi5 is underused because we’re still designing for 2004.**

Switching specs without changing process is like switching your pen and hoping your writing improves.

## Final Thought

If your team is exploring these standards, don’t just ask *what* they do, ask what you're actually trying to achieve.  

- Need modern, flexible tracking? **xAPI** is your base but comes with significant costs in development.  
- Want to replace SCORM responsibly? **cmi5** is the only realistic candidate but is poorly understood and requires significant changes in design mindset.  
- Still building traditional eLearning modules with no tracking needs beyond "completed"? **SCORM still works**, but it's not future-proof.

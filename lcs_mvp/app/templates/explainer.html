<h1>What is this system</h1>
<p class="muted">A plain-language explainer for first-time users.</p>

    AI is strongest on established patterns and weakest at novelty. Newly released software, fresh regulatory changes, and emerging ways of working are exactly where hallucination risk is highest, and they are also the highest priority learning areas for most organizations.
  </p>
  <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
    Blueprinted-io introduces a human-in-the-loop middleware layer between source documentation and AI-generated learning outputs. Humans structure and validate the critical concepts, workflows, and dependencies before delivery. The result is faster content production with controlled accuracy, explicit oversight, and clear auditability, so organizations in high risk or regulated environments can use AI output with confidence, traceability, and governance.

  <h2>What this does for you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Build trusted learning content faster:</b> convert source material into reusable, governed records.</li>
    <li><b>Keep human control where it matters:</b> critical content is reviewed before confirmation.</li>
    <li><b>Produce audit-ready outputs:</b> every version and approval decision is traceable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Ingest source inputs</b> <span class="badge badge-warn">early development, not yet functional</span><br><span class="muted">Technical documentation, learning content, and knowledge-base material are brought into the system.</span></li>
    <li><b>Structure and validate with humans-in-the-loop</b><br><span class="muted">Authors and reviewers create and govern Tasks and Workflows, with explicit review gates.</span></li>
    <li><b>Deliver controlled outputs</b> <span class="badge badge-warn">early development, not yet functional</span><br><span class="muted">Confirmed records drive content output, assessments, and assurance evidence.</span></li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Who should use which area</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Viewer:</b> Workflows, Content output</li>
    <li><b>Author:</b> Ingestion, Tasks, Workflows</li>
    <li><b>Reviewer:</b> Review queue, submitted Tasks/Workflows</li>
    <li><b>Content publisher:</b> Content output and delivery artifacts</li>
    <li><b>Assessment author:</b> Assessments linked to governed records</li>
    <li><b>Audit:</b> Assurance and audit log visibility</li>
    <li><b>Admin:</b> Full access including break-glass operations</li>
  </ul>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Core model (for authors and reviewers)</h2>

  <h3>Task</h3>
  <p class="muted">A Task is the smallest unit of work that changes the world in one observable way.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Outcome:</b> the result you can verify.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> literal information required before starting.</li>
    <li><b>Concepts:</b> the mental model that explains why the procedure works.</li>
    <li><b>Procedure:</b> a list of Steps.</li>
    <li><b>Dependencies:</b> what must already be true.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Workflow</h3>
  <p class="muted">A Workflow is an ordered list of Tasks that achieves one objective.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Workflows contain <b>Tasks</b>, not low-level steps.</li>
    <li>The Workflow objective defines the business outcome for the set of Tasks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step</h3>
  <p>A Step is one unit of procedure inside a Task.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Step text (required):</b> what you are doing.</li>
    <li><b>Actions (optional):</b> tool-specific details for execution.</li>
    <li><b>Completion (required):</b> how you prove the step is done.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">Important: confirmation lives in <b>Completion</b>. Actions do not have separate completion rules.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Status lifecycle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Draft:</b> being written, not trusted yet.</li>
    <li><b>Submitted:</b> waiting for review.</li>
    <li><b>Returned:</b> reviewed, but changes are required before confirmation.</li>
    <li><b>Confirmed:</b> reviewed and approved, safe to reuse and export.</li>
    <li><b>Deprecated:</b> older confirmed version replaced by a newer confirmed version.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>What this system is not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not a chat bot.</li>
    <li>It is not a free-form wiki. Confirmed content is controlled and versioned.</li>
    <li>It is not currently designed for operational use in production environments.</li>
  </ul>

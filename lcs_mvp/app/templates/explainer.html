    AI is strongest on established patterns and weakest at novelty. Newly released software, fresh regulatory changes, and emerging ways of working are exactly where hallucination risk is highest, and they are also the highest priority learning areas for most organizations.
  </p>
  <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">
    Blueprinted-io introduces a human-in-the-loop middleware layer between source documentation and AI-generated learning outputs. Humans structure and validate the critical concepts, workflows, and dependencies before delivery. The result is faster content production with controlled accuracy, explicit oversight, and clear auditability, so organizations in high risk or regulated environments can use AI output with confidence, traceability, and governance.

  <h2>In one sentence</h2>
  <p>
    This is a governed library of small, verifiable procedures (Tasks) that can be reused and combined into bigger goals (Workflows).
  </p>

  <h2>Why it exists</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Consistency:</b> everyone follows the same approved procedure.</li>
    <li><b>Safety:</b> changes are reviewed before they are treated as “correct”.</li>
    <li><b>Reusability:</b> we write a good Task once and reuse it everywhere.</li>
    <li><b>Traceability:</b> every version and decision is recorded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The two record types</h2>

  <h3>Task</h3>
  <p class="muted">A Task is the smallest unit of work that changes the world in one observable way.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Outcome:</b> the result you can verify.</li>
    <li><b>Facts:</b> literal info you need before starting.</li>
    <li><b>Concepts:</b> the mental model (why this works).</li>
    <li><b>Procedure:</b> a list of Steps.</li>
    <li><b>Dependencies:</b> what must already be true.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Workflow</h3>
  <p class="muted">A Workflow is an ordered list of Tasks that achieves one objective.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Workflows contain <b>Tasks</b>, not low-level steps.</li>
    <li>The Workflow objective is the “why are we doing this?” for the group of Tasks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is a Step</h2>
  <p>A Step is one unit of procedure inside a Task.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Step text (required):</b> what you are doing.</li>
    <li><b>Actions (optional):</b> how to do it (tool-specific sub-steps).</li>
    <li><b>Completion (required):</b> how you prove the step is done.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">Important: confirmation lives in <b>Completion</b>. Actions do not have their own completion rules.</p>

  <h2>Status, in plain language</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Draft:</b> being written. Not trusted yet.</li>
    <li><b>Submitted:</b> waiting for review.</li>
    <li><b>Returned:</b> reviewed, but needs changes before it can be confirmed.</li>
    <li><b>Confirmed:</b> reviewed and approved. Safe to reuse and export.</li>
    <li><b>Deprecated:</b> old confirmed version that has been replaced.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Roles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Viewer:</b> can browse content (read-only).</li>
    <li><b>Author:</b> creates drafts and submits them for review (within entitled domains). Authors own document ingress.</li>
    <li><b>Reviewer:</b> reviews submissions and confirms only what is verifiably correct (within entitled domains).</li>
    <li><b>Audit:</b> read-only access including the audit log.</li>
    <li><b>Admin:</b> break-glass role. Can do admin operations and force submit/confirm (these actions are logged). Admin can also perform ingress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What this system is not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not a chat bot.</li>
    <li>It is not a troubleshooting guide. (Troubleshooting is out of scope for canonical procedure.)</li>
    <li>It is not a free-form wiki. Confirmed content is controlled and versioned.</li>
  </ul>
